stock_picker,substrings,cesar_cypher,merge_sort


The cesar_cypher was pretty familiar, I had did it about a year ago in javascript.The substrings method foregin to me and I took a few hours but I got it.The hardest one was the stock_picker.

The merge sort method came off as a bit odd I ended up using a recursive methodology but after looking at other methods my 
merge sort did not follow conventional methods but used less code
